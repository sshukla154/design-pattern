1. Singleton Design Pattern: Create only one object whenever asked.

2. Factory Design Pattern: Create output depending on input. Consider a class/interface has many subclasses. So
   depending upon the input we need to get one instance, this is Factory design patter.
   In this we don't need client to see the implementation.
